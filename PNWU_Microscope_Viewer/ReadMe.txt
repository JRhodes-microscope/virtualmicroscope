The PNWU Virtual Microscope comes in two parts:  a Viewer and the SlideBox.  
This directory contains the principal files needed by the PNWU Virtual Microscope Viewer.  The Viewer is the program that displays the virtual slides.  
The Viewer currently consists of one HTML file (Microscope.htm), two style sheets, and 11 javascript files, in addition to ancillary files.  
Many of the ancillary files are found in the "Images" directory (see root directory) for this project.  These image files should be located in a directory at the same 'level' as this directory on the server (e.g., calls to "../images/PNWU_icon.png").
The Viewer also requires three PHP files (see "SQLphp" directory), which should be in directory that is at the same 'level' on the server as this directory (e.g., calls to "../SQLphp/jrSQL_GetSldBasic.php").
This version of the Viewer progam is version 3.04 ("Box03"), December 7, 2020.
