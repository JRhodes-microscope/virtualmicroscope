PNWU Virtual Microscope

The PNWU Virtual Microscope is a web-based program for displaying multifocal-plane, whole-slide-scanned microscope slides ("virtual slides") using an image-tile architecture similar to that used by the Google Maps API.  A version of this program can be seen at http://viewer.pnwu.edu.  The Virtual Microscope consists of two modules:  the SlideBox, which displayes the list of available slides and allows the user to choose which slide to display, and the Viewer (the "Microscope") which displays the chosen slide. 

Currently (December, 2020) the principal components of the Viewer, which can be found in the "PNWU_Virtual_Microscope program, consists of one HTML file (Microscope.htm), two CSS files (jrscpStyleMain.css & jrscpStyleInfo.css), eleven javascript files (jrscpGlobal.js, jrscpProg.js, jrscpSldView.js, jrscpMove.js, jrscpFZ.js, jrscpMenu.js, jrscpTouchMain.js, jrscpTouchMenu.js, jrscpCmdLine.js, jrscpChgSet1.js, & jrscpChgSet2.js) and three PHP files (jrSQL_GetSldBasic.php, jrSQL_GetSldInfo.php, & jrSQL_GetZYX.php); there also are ancilliary files (jpg, png, wav). Except for the PHP files, the principal files can be found in the directory (on GitHub) entitled "PNWU_Microscope_Viewer"; these components of the viewer need to be located within the same folder (directory) on the server.  The PHP files can be found in the directory (on GitHub) entitled "SQLphp"; on the server, these PHP files need to be located in a directory named "SQLphp" that is at the same level as the directory containing the rest of the Viewer's principal files (i.e., the are addressed by Ajax calls to "../SQLphp/'filename.php'").  The ancillary files (which also have been copied to GitHub) must be located in a directory named "images" that is at the same level on the server as 'UserFiles' (i.e., they are accessed by calls to "../images/'filename.jpg'").

The files comprising the Slide Box portion of the "PNWU Virtual Microscope" are found (on GitHub) in the directory named "PNWU_SlideBox".  This part of the virtual microscope system consists of nine files: one HTML file ("SlideBox.htm"), one style sheet ("jrsbStyleMain.css"), six kavascript files ("jrsbGlobal.js", "jrsbSelect.js", "jrsbRegAjax.js", "jrsbList.js", "jrsbMenu.js", & "jrsbTouch.js"), and one PHP file ("jrSB_GetSldLst.php").  These files should be in the same directory on the server

Besides a database of microscope-image tiles, the program also relies on a SQL database containing metadata relative to each microscope slide.

Questions or comments regarding the PNWU Virtual Microscope can be emailed to:  Microscope@PNWU.edu.  In addition to several known bugs, there undoubtedly are many bugs in the program that are still waiting to be discovered.  We encourage you to take the Viewer (http://viwer.pnwu.edu) out for a test-run, and we welcome any help you might be able to provide in finding and identifying bugs.  Bugs can be reported to MicroscopeBugs@PNWU.edu.
  
There are many aspects of the project that still need to be developed, and we would be delighted to have collaborators.  If you are interested in helping with this project, please email Jim Rhodes using the contact information listed in "About" => "About PNWU Microscope" in the microscope viewer:  http://viewer.pnwu.edu.
