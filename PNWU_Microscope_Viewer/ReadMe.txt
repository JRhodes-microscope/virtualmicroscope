The PNWU Virtual Microscope comes in two parts:  a Viewer and the SlideBox.  This directory contains the principal files needed by the PNWU Virtual Microscope Viewer.  The Viewer is the program that displays the virtual slides.  The Viewer currently consists of one HTML file (Microscope.htm), two style sheets, and 11 javascript files, in addition to ancillary files.  Many of the ancillary files are found in the "Images" directory (see root directory) for this project.  The Viewer also requires three PHP files (see "PHP" directory).
